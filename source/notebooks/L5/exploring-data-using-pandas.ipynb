    "Materials for this lesson are from Chapter 3 of the forthcoming textbook [*Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis*](https://pythongis.org/). In this lesson we cover the materials from [Chapter 3.1 (Getting started with data analysis)](https://pythongis.org/part1/chapter-03/nb/00-pandas-basics.html). A brief description of the data used in this lesson can also be found below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our input data is a text file containing weather observations from Kumpula, Helsinki, Finland retrieved from the [Finnish Meteorlogical Institute (FMI)](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi):\n",
    "\n",
    "- File name: [`kumpula-summer-2024.txt`](kumpula-summer-2024.txt) (have a look at the file before reading it in using `pandas`!)\n",
    "- The file is available in Binder and the CSC Noppe platforms in the `L5/data`  \n",
    "- The data file contains observed daily temperatures recorded twice per day (TEMP1: 10AM, TEMP2: 4PM) as well as minimum, and maximum temperatures from Summer 2024 (1.6.2024 - 31.8.2024) recorded from the Kumpula weather observation station in Helsinki.\n",
    "- There are 92 rows of data in this sample data set.\n",
    "- The data has been derived from a data file of daily temperature measurements downloaded from the [FMI data service](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data). The structure of the data in the file has been modified for use in this lesson."
